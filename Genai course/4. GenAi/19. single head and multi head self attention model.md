## 🌟 What is Self-Attention? (Quick Refresher)

Imagine you're reading:

> “The lion chased the zebra because **it** was hungry.”

To understand **“it”**, your brain attends to the **most relevant earlier word** — likely "lion", not "zebra".

🧠 That’s **self-attention**: a word looking at other words and figuring out **what to focus on** to understand its role in the sentence.

## 🟢 SINGLE-HEAD SELF-ATTENTION

### 🔧 How it works (step-by-step):

1. **Input words** are turned into vectors.
2. These vectors are **projected into 3 spaces**:
    - Query (Q)
    - Key (K)
    - Value (V)
3. You compute:
```
Attention = softmax(Q × Kᵀ / √d_k) × V
```

Result → **Context-aware representation** of each word.
### 📌 Key Traits:

|Property|Value|
|---|---|
|Q, K, V sets|Only 1 set|
|Perspectives|Just 1|
|Simple and fast|✅|
|Less expressive|❌ Limited insight|

## 🔴 MULTI-HEAD SELF-ATTENTION

### 🔧 How it works (upgraded version):

1. You do **Single-Head Attention** but **multiple times in parallel**.
2. Each attention head has **its own Q, K, V matrices**.
3. Each head learns to focus on **different things**:
    - Head 1 → grammatical structure
    - Head 2 → pronoun resolution
    - Head 3 → word meaning
4. The results from all heads are **concatenated and projected** into one final vector.

### 📌 Key Traits:

| Property              | Value                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Q, K, V sets          | Multiple (e.g. 8, 12, 16...)   |
| Perspectives          | Multiple                       |
| More expressive       | ✅ Learns complex relationships |
| Requires more compute | ❌ Slower and heavier           |

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogy:

| Scenario                        | Single-Head                    | Multi-Head                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A person solving a puzzle alone | Looks at only one type of clue | Gets help from multiple friends, each looking at a different clue |
| Camera                          | One camera lens                | Multiple lenses focused on different angles                       |
| Human brain                     | One neuron focusing            | Multiple neurons collaborating                                    |

       (Single Head)
```


```
Input → Multiple Q/K/V → Multiple Attentions → Concatenate → Final Output
             ↑               ↑
          Head 1         Head 2 ...
         (Multi Head)
