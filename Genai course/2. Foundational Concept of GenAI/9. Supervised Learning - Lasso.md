## 📘 What’s This All About?

Both **Lasso** and **Ridge** are **regularized versions of Linear Regression**. They help when:

- Your model is overfitting
- You have too many features
- You want better generalization (i.e., good predictions on new data)

## ✅ Regularization = “Penalty for Complexity”

In simple Linear Regression, we minimize this:

👉 But in **Lasso and Ridge**, we add a penalty to reduce complexity.

### 🟠 Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

📏 Formula:
![](/images/Pasted image 20250609120308.png)

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`λ` (lambda)|Controls how much penalty you apply (0 = no penalty)|
### 💡 Key Feature:

- **Does feature selection**!  
    It can **shrink some weights to exactly zero**, effectively **removing irrelevant features**.

### 🧠 Real-Life Analogy:

Lasso is like Marie Kondo for machine learning — it throws out features that don’t “spark joy” 😄.

### 🟡 Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

📏 Formula:

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`λ` (lambda)|Controls penalty strength|
|`m_i^2`|Square of weight (L2 penalty)|
### 💡 Key Feature:

- **Shrinks all weights**, but **doesn’t make them zero**
- Helps with **multicollinearity** (when inputs are correlated)

## ⚖️ Lasso vs Ridge (When to Use What)

| Situation                   | Use Lasso                       | Use Ridge        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 🔢 Many features            | ✅ Yes                           | ✅ Yes            |
| 🧹 Need feature selection   | ✅ Yes (makes some weights zero) | ❌ No (keeps all) |
| 🔁 Features are correlated  | ❌ No                            | ✅ Yes            |
| 🧠 Model simplicity matters | ✅ Yes                           | ❌ No             |
| 🧮 All features are useful  | ❌ No                            | ✅ Yes            |

🧠 **Easy Rule**:

- If you want to **remove useless features**, use **Lasso**
- If all features are important but just need to **prevent overfitting**, use **Ridge**

## 🧪 Final Summary

| Term           | Meaning                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1 = Lasso** | Penalty = sum of absolute weights                          |
| **L2 = Ridge** | Penalty = sum of squared weights                           |
| **λ (lambda)** | Controls how strict you are — higher = more regularization |

## 📝 Lifetime Memory Tip:

> **Lasso L1** – "1" looks like a stick → sticks to **few features only**  
> **Ridge L2** – "2" is round → **smooths** all features without removing
