## 1️⃣ One-to-One

📦 **Architecture**:

- Single input → Single output
- Like traditional feedforward or CNN models.

🧠 **Use Case**:

- Image classification  
    _(Input: Image → Output: Label like 'Cat')_

🧪 **Example**:
- MNIST digit recognition (Input = 28x28 image, Output = 0-9 digit)

📌 **When to use**:
- When you have **one input = one prediction**
- Static, non-sequential data

---

## 2️⃣ One-to-Many

📦 **Architecture**:
- One input → Sequence of outputs

🧠 **Use Case**:

- Image captioning  
    _(Input: Image → Output: Caption like “a cat sitting on a sofa”)_

🧪 **Example**:
- You upload a photo, AI generates a sentence.

📌 **When to use**:

- When a **single data point leads to a sequence**
- Ex: **Story generation from a topic**

---

## 3️⃣ Many-to-Many

📦 **Architecture**:

- Sequence of inputs → Sequence of outputs
- Inputs and outputs are **aligned**.

🧠 **Use Case**:

- Translation (e.g., English to Hindi)  
    _(Input: "I love you" → Output: "Main tumse pyaar karta hoon")_
    
🧪 **Example**:

- Video-to-video labeling
- Language translation
- Chatbots

📌 **When to use**:

- When both **input and output are sequences of same/similar length**
- Ex: Sequence tagging, video frame classification

---

## 4️⃣ Many-to-One

📦 **Architecture**:

- Sequence of inputs → Single output

🧠 **Use Case**:

- Sentiment analysis  
    _(Input: Review text → Output: Sentiment = Positive or Negative)_

🧪 **Example**:

- "This phone is amazing!" → Positive

📌 **When to use**:

- When you analyze a **sequence to get one summary or label**

## 🧠 Bonus – Quick Real-World Analogies

|Architecture|Real-Life Analogy|
|---|---|
|One-to-One|Showing one X-ray → Get a disease label|
|One-to-Many|One image → Describe it in a sentence|
|Many-to-Many|Sentence in English → Sentence in Hindi|
|Many-to-One|Movie review text → Sentiment score|

## 📝 Extra Points to Remember

- These architectures are commonly used in **RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformers**.
- You can **mix architectures** (e.g., LSTM+CNN for video tagging).
- In **chatbots**, you often see Many-to-Many with **Transformer encoder-decoder**.
