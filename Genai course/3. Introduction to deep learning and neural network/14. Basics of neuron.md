## 🧠 What is an Artificial Neuron?

An **artificial neuron** mimics a **biological neuron**.  
It takes input, **processes it**, and gives an output – like how your brain processes signals.

## 🧩 Anatomy of an Artificial Neuron (from the image)

### 1. **Inputs (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ)**

- These are your **features** (e.g., age, height, pixel values in an image)
### 2. **Weights (w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ)**

- These decide **how important** each input is
- Bigger weight → more influence

📌 **Real-life analogy**:  
Imagine you're grading students. Homework = 20%, Exam = 70%, Participation = 10%  
Those percentages are the **weights**.

### 3. **Summation**

- Multiply each input by its weight and add them up.

🧠 This is like calculating a **weighted score**.
### 4. **Activation Function**

y^​=f(z)

- Applies a mathematical function to **introduce non-linearity**
- Popular activations:
    - **Sigmoid**: Converts to values between 0 and 1
    - **ReLU**: Keeps only positive values
    - **tanh**: Values between -1 and 1

📌 Activation helps the neuron make complex decisions.

### 5. **Output**

- Final value that the neuron returns (prediction)

## 🔁 When to Use Artificial Neurons (Neural Networks)

|Use Case|Why It Works|
|---|---|
|🖼️ Image Recognition|Learns patterns like edges, shapes|
|🗣️ Voice Assistants|Converts speech to text using deep layers|
|💬 Chatbots / NLP|Understands and generates language|
|📊 Stock Prediction|Learns trends from data over time|

## 🔍 Types of Neural Networks (Where Neurons Are Used)

| Network                     | Where It’s Used                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Feedforward NN**          | Basic problems like classification            |
| **CNN (Convolutional NN)**  | Images, videos                                |
| **RNN (Recurrent NN)**      | Sequences like time series, text              |
| **GAN (Generative)**        | Creating new images or text                   |
| **Transformers (like GPT)** | Language modeling, translation, summarization |
## 🧠 Memory Tip

- **Inputs × Weights → Sum → Activation → Output**
- Like: Ingredients × Proportion → Mix → Cook → Dish 🍲

## 💡 Extra Tip: Why Activation Function?

Without it, the model would just be a **linear function**.  
Activation makes it capable of learning **non-linear patterns** — like curves, edges, emotions, etc.
