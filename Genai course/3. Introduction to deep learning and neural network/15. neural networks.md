## 🧠 What is a Neural Network?

A **neural network** is like a network of **artificial brain cells** (neurons) working together to learn patterns in data and make predictions.

## 🌐 Key Terms from the Image (explained simply):

### 1. **Layers**

Layers are levels in the network.

|Layer|What it does|
|---|---|
|🟦 **Input Layer**|Takes raw data (e.g., x1 to x5)|
|⚫ **Hidden Layer**|Learns patterns, calculations happen here|
|🟥 **Output Layer**|Gives final prediction (like [1, 0, 0] = Class A)|

🧠 **Tip**: More hidden layers = deeper learning → “Deep Neural Network”

### 2. **Neurons (Nodes)**

Each circle is a **neuron**, just like in the brain.  
It processes input, applies weights, adds bias, and passes output.

### 3. **Bias**

Bias helps neurons **adjust predictions** more flexibly.

📌 Think of it like turning a line into a curve — helps model shift the output up/down when needed.

### 4. **Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)**

Each neuron in one layer is connected to **every neuron in the next layer**.
This means the model:
- Can **learn complex patterns**
- Is called a **dense network**

## 🔁 How It Works (Feedforward + Backpropagation)

### 📥 Step 1: **Feedforward**

Data flows from input → hidden layers → output.
- Multiply inputs by weights
- Add bias
- Pass result through activation function (like ReLU or Sigmoid)

### 🧮 Step 2: **Calculate Error**

Error=y−y^​

Where:
- `y` = actual value
- `ŷ` = predicted value

### 🔁 Step 3: **Backpropagation**

- The model goes backward
- It updates weights to **reduce the error**
- Like learning from mistakes!
This cycle is repeated many times → this is called **training**.

## 🧱 Shallow vs Deep Neural Network

|Type|Layers|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Shallow**|Only 1 hidden layer|Simple tasks like binary classification|
|**Deep**|2+ hidden layers|Complex tasks like image recognition, NLP|

## 📦 When to Use Neural Networks?

|Use Case|Why It Works|
|---|---|
|🖼️ Image Recognition (e.g., Face detection)|Deep layers learn edges, shapes, features|
|🗣️ Speech to Text|Captures complex voice patterns|
|🧠 ChatGPT-like models|Used in large language models (transformers)|
|💸 Fraud Detection|Learns hidden, non-obvious patterns in data|

## 📌 Extra Points Not in the Image (To Remember Forever):

### ✨ Activation Functions:

- **ReLU** (most common): keeps only positive values
- **Sigmoid**: gives output between 0 and 1 (probability)
- **Softmax**: used in output for classification (e.g., predicting A, B, or C)

### ✨ Loss Functions (used in calculating error):

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: for regression
- **Cross-Entropy**: for classification

### ✨ Optimizers (used in backpropagation):

- **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**
- **Adam (Adaptive + Momentum)** – most used!
