### What is Machine Learning
Machine Learning is teaching computers to **learn from data** instead of being explicitly programmed. Think of it like training a dog  it learns what to do based on your feedback.

## Supervised Learning
In this type of learning, you give the computer **labeled data** (i.e., you tell it the answer).

### ✴️A. **Classification**
Used when the output is a **category/label**.
**Examples:**
- Spam or Not Spam (Email classification)
- Predicting if a patient has a disease (Yes/No)

**Algorithms:**
- **Naive Bayes** – Works well with text classification (e.g., spam detection).
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** – If your neighbors are doctors, you're likely a doctor. It classifies by majority vote from nearby points.
- **Decision Tree** – Like playing 20 questions, it splits data based on decisions.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** – Draws a line/boundary that separates classes.
- **Logistic Regression** – Predicts probabilities between 0 and 1 (Yes/No).

## ✴️ B. **Regression**
Used when the output is a **number**.
**Examples:**
- Predicting house prices
- Estimating temperature tomorrow

**Algorithms:**
- **Linear Regression** – Draws a straight line through data.
- **L1/L2 Regularization** – Prevents overfitting by adding penalties.
- **Polynomial Regression** – Fits curved lines (good for complex trends).


✅ **Tip to Remember:**
- Classification = Label (Category)
- Regression = Number (Value)


### 🧠 **Semi-Supervised Learning**

A mix of **labeled and unlabeled data**.
**Example:**
- A few labeled images of cats and dogs, many unlabeled. The model uses the labeled ones to guess the rest.
    
Used in:
- **Language translation**
- **Text labeling tasks**

### 📈 Predictive Model
Models that **predict an output** based on input.
**Example:**
- Netflix predicting what movie you’ll like next based on your watch history.

## 🔍 Unsupervised Learning

There is **no label** in the data. The model tries to **discover patterns**.
#### ✴️ A. **Clustering**
Grouping similar items.
**Examples:**
- Customer segmentation in marketing
- Grouping animals based on features

**Algorithms:**
- **K-Means** – Finds "K" groups in data.
- **Agglomerative Clustering** – Bottom-up approach, merging groups step by step.
#### ✴️ B. **Association**
Find relationships among variables.
**Examples:**
- Market Basket Analysis: People who buy bread often buy butter.

**Algorithm:**
- **FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth)** – Efficient algorithm to find frequent itemsets.

### 🕹️  Reinforcement Learning

Learning via **trial and error**  like training a pet with **rewards and penalties**.

**Examples:**
- Training a robot to walk
- Game-playing AI (like Chess or Go)

Key Idea: **Agent learns what action gets most reward** in an environment.

### 🧩 Types of Features (Data Columns)

These are types of **input data**:

- **Categorical** – Categories like color (Red, Blue)
- **Discrete** – Countable numbers (e.g., Number of children)
- **Ordinal** – Ranked data (e.g., small < medium < large)
- **Continuous** – Measurable, with infinite possibilities (e.g., height, weight)

Trick to Remember:
- CDO C: "Cats Dance On Carpets" → Categorical, Discrete, Ordinal, Continuous

### 🔗 Independent vs Dependent Data

In the table shown:
- **Independent Data (Features):**  
    These are the inputs like Age, Temperature, Humidity.
- **Dependent Data (Target/Label):**  
    What we want to predict — e.g., Will it Rain (Y/N)?



## 🧠 RULE: Always Start With The Question!

### ❓ Is the Output a **Category** or a **Number**?



### 🎯 If You Want to Predict a **Category** (Classification

### ➤ Use These When:

|Algorithm|Use When|Example|Industry Use|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Logistic Regression**|When you want a fast and simple classifier|Email is spam or not|Banking fraud detection|
|**Naive Bayes**|When data is text and you want quick results|Classifying news as sports/politics|Email spam filtering|
|**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**|When data is small and you want simplicity|Recommend based on similar users|Recommendation systems|
|**Decision Tree**|When you want human-understandable rules|Loan approval rules|Credit scoring|
|**SVM**|When data is complex, high-dimensional|Image classification|Face detection|

**Memory Hack**:

- Text? Use **Naive Bayes**
- Speed? Use **Logistic Regression**
- Interpretability? Use **Decision Tree**
- Complex images/texts? Use **SVM**
